# Graph Visualization Tool

A C++ application for visualizing paths and maze structures using Graphviz. This tool generates .gv files that can be rendered into graphical representations of paths through mazes and other grid-based structures.

## Features

- **Path Visualization**: Generate clean, directed graphs showing paths between points
- **Maze Integration**: Visualize paths overlaid on maze structures with wall detection
- **Color Coding**: Automatic color differentiation for start points, end points, path nodes, and obstacles
- **BFS Path Display**: Specialized visualization for Breadth-First Search algorithms
- **Graphviz Compatibility**: Outputs standard .gv files compatible with Graphviz tools

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **C++ Compiler** (C++11 or higher)
- **Graphviz** 

### Installing Graphviz

**Windows:**
```bash
choco install graphviz
